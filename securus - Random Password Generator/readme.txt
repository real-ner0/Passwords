securus : means secure in Latin.
Project made during Quarantine session :)

securus is a Ruby base script which generates a string of a given length consisting of Alphabets (lower and upper), numbers and some special characters.

Just paste "securus" in "/bin/" and reset the terminal and 

root@kali:~ securus -l 50     or      root@kali:~ securus --length 50

Output :
